//         'The "exposure triangle" in photography refers to the interconnection between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. These settings work together to control the amount of light entering the camera and determine the overall exposure of the image. Adjusting one setting affects the others, forming a triangle-like relationship. Mastering the exposure triangle enables photographers to achieve proper exposure and create desired visual effects in their photos.',

//       explanation:
//         'The purpose of the aperture in photography is to control the depth of field. It determines how much of the image is in sharp focus. A larger aperture creates a shallow depth of field, blurring the background and emphasizing the subject. A smaller aperture increases the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus from front to back.',

//       explanation:
//         `Shutter speed controls the exposure of the image by determining how long the camera's shutter remains open. It affects the amount of light that enters the camera. Longer shutter speeds result in brighter exposures, while shorter shutter speeds result in darker exposures. Photographers use shutter speed to control the overall exposure of their images.`,

//         ISO in photography represents the sensitivity of the camera's sensor to light. Higher ISO values make the sensor more sensitive, resulting in brighter images in low-light conditions. Photographers adjust ISO to control exposure and image quality.`,

//       explanation:
//         `The camera's white balance setting is used to correct the color temperature of the image. Different light sources emit light with varying color temperatures, resulting in different color casts in photos. The white balance setting helps ensure accurate color reproduction by adjusting the image's color temperature to match the lighting conditions. It helps eliminate unwanted color tints, such as overly warm (yellow/orange) or cool (blue) tones, and allows for more natural and balanced colors in the photograph.`,
